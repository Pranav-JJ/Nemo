# Nemo

## Inspiration:

The inspiration behind **Nemo** stemmed from recognizing the challenges that individuals including ourselves have faced in accessing mental health support. The idea was to create a companion that navigates the complexities of emotions, symbolized by the great vastness of the ocean.

## What It Does:

**Nemo** is a web-based companion app designed to guide its users on their mental wellness journey. It utilizes NLP to provide a *conversational feature* akin to that of a companion and sentiment analysis to *track and asses emotions* over time, providing insights into emotional patterns. Additionally, it offers a dedicated section with *curated resources* for users to explore independently.

## How We Built It:

**Nemo** was built using a tech stack that includes **HTML, CSS, and jQuery** for the frontend, while **Flask** served as the backend. The conversational model and sentiment analysis leveraged **Hugging Face** and **Pytorch**, integrating *Natural Language Processing* into the fold.

## Challenges We Ran Into:

Balancing the intricacies of sentiment analysis with user simplicity posed a significant challenge. Fine tuning the model for accurate emotion capture to ensure accurate and empathetic replies. Maintaining a seamless integration of technology and empathy presented its own set of challenges, but each obstacle fueled our determination to create a comprehensive mental health companion.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of:

Crafting a seamless web-based companion that combines technology with empathy, offering users invaluable insights into their emotional well-being. Developing a tracking feature that paints a vivid picture of the user's mental health journey over time.

## What We Learned:

The project taught us the power of combining technology with empathy and the importance of addressing mental health concerns concerns in a contemporary context. The challenges turned into opportunities for growth and innovation.

## What's Next for Nemo:

The future holds continuous refinement and expansion for **Nemo**. We aim to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy, introduce new features, and explore partnerships to commercialize the application to broaden the impact of our companion.
